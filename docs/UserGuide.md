RecruiterPlus is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, RecruiterPlus can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F09-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your RecruiterPlus.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar recruiterplus.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will display the command reference in the command output.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add -name John Doe -phone 98765432 -email johnd@example.com -address John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the RecruiterPlus.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add -name NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add -name John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `-name NAME [-tag TAG]` can be used as `-name John Doe -tag friend` or as `-name John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[-tag TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `-tag friend`, `-tag friend -tag family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-name NAME -phone PHONE_NUMBER`, `-phone PHONE_NUMBER -name NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

RecruiterPlus data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

RecruiterPlus data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/recruiterplus.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Malformed entries are quarantined into `addressbook_invalid.json` during startup preprocessing, while valid entries are kept in the main data file. This helps prevent silent data loss when only some records are invalid.<br>
However, if the overall file is severely corrupted or contains values that violate model constraints, the app may still fail to load some entries. It is recommended to keep a backup before editing the data file manually.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous RecruiterPlus home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
